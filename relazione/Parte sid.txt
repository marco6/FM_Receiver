Phase Detector

The phase detector needs to compute the phase difference of its two input signals, in this case Fin and Cout, that is the output of NCO. It is based on following trigonometric formula, so it implement a multiplicaion (with a successive and appropriate rounding).

Let α be the phase of the first input and β be the phase of the second.

The first term provides the desired phase difference as a voltage scaled by a factor 2. The second term is a sinusoid at twice the reference frequency, so it can be filtered out by following L)oop Filter.

Sampler (ho un sacco di dubbi sul suo funzionamento)

It is a circuit that take one sample every N input samples. In this case is used to get rid of the intermediate steps of the integration obtaining a more linear interpolation between the samples and reduceing the sampling rate: otherwise the output of the adder would have too many swings.
The input is the output of Adder and the output is mapped on the input of the external low-pass filter.
