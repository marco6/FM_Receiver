(5)Loop Filter:

This component a low pass filter, takes in input a 12 bits signal from the Phase Detector and outputs a 12 bits filtered signal for the NCO.
Its pourpose is to remove the high frequency components, generated from the operation done by the Phase Detector.
We decide to implement this component as a Moving Average Filter, it computes the average of N signals, and the value of N depends on what is the value of frequency we want to cut off.

As we can see in this immage, obtained using Matlab as simulator, by computing the average of four signals we obtain a complete rejection of the frequency we want to eliminate.
