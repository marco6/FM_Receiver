(5)Loop Filter:

This component a low pass filter, takes in input a 12 bits signal from the Phase Detector and outputs a 12 bits filtered signal for the NCO.
Its pourpose is to remove the high frequency components, generated from the quadrature.
We decide to implement this component as a Moving Average Filter: it computes the average of N signals, and the value of N depends on what is the value of frequency we want to cut off. In our case N is equal to 4.

As we can see in this immage, obtained using Matlab as simulator, by computing the average of four signals we obtain a complete rejection of the carrier frequency. The graph clearly shows that in order to obtain a rejection of at least -20 dB, deviation should be less than 5.5 kHz.

Adder:

The purpose of this component is to demodulate a Pulse Width Modulated (PWM) signal.
It take in input the signal come from the XOR and outputs a demodulated signal to the Sampler.
The output is obtained by adding or subtracting a certain quantity based on the sign of the signal come from the XOR (i.e. integrating the signal).
